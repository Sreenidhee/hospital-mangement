managing the hospital
The mini-project “Hospital Management System Project” is a console application using the C programming language. This project compiles in Code Blocks with the GCC compiler. In this console application, you can do basic Patient Record tasks like adding the Patient info, view the added Patient, search the Patient, ..etc.

This application is based on file handling in C, where I have used a file-related function like fopen, fread, fwrite, .
